## Instructions for adding quote to webpage

1. Add the "quoter" folder in the same directory as the your HTML file.

2. In your HTML file, create a div with `id = quoter-container`. This is where the quote will be displayed (you should allow just under 280px height and 520px width for the quote to be displayed).

3. At the bottom of your HTML head element, include the following:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="quoter/style.css" type="text/css"></link>`

4. At the bottom of your HTML body element, include the following:

`<script src="quoter/main.js" type="text/javascript"></script>`

5. And... that's it! If it works.
