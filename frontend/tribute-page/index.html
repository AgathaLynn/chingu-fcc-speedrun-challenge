      <h1>Ferdinand Magellan</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Most versed in nautical charts, he knew better than any other the true art of navigation, of which it is certain proof that he by his genius, and his intrepidity, without anyone having given him the example, how to attempt the circuit of the globe which he had almost completed... The glory of Magellan will survive him.</p>

      <h2>Life</h2>
      <p>Portuguese Explorer Ferdinand Magellan (c. 1480 - 1521) led the first successful expedition to circumnavigate the globe. Although Magellan himself did not survive the attempt, his legacy lives on and, even after nearly 500 years, he is still remembered for his courage and daring.</p>

      <h3>An Idea is Born</h3>
      <p>After working for many years as Portuguese sailor involved in the spice trade, Magellan determined to find a better way. If only he could avoid the arduous journey around Africa and India and the heavy taxes and upcharges on imported spices... When he came across a report of the discovery of a channel through South America, Magellan was convinced that he had found this better way.</p>

      <h3>The Journey Begins</h3>
      <p>Once Magellan determined to reach the Spice Islands by sailing across the Atlantic Ocean, he let nothing stand in his way:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When Portugal refused to sponsor his trip, he sought - and received - Spanish sponsorship for his expedition</li>
        <li>When Magellan discovered that his source was in error - the promised channel turned out to only a bay - he refused to turn back and instead began systematically searching the South American coastline for some other passage</li>
        <li>Even after three of his five ships mutanied and one of his ships deserted and sailed back to Spain with a large quantity of supplies, Magellan refused to turn back</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Price of Victory</h3>
      <p>Magellan's obstinance and daring did pay off: he discovered the Strait of Magellan, successfully crossed the Pacific Ocean and reached the "Spice Islands". But his success came at great cost. Many of his soldiers lost their lives crossing the Pacific, and many more nearly died of starvation.</p>
      <p>In the end, it was Magellan's bravado that got him killed. He died in the Battle of Mactan in the Phillipines, an attempted show of strength intended to convince the monarch of Cebu of the power of Spain.</p>

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>Far from forgotten, Magellan's influence and legacy still exist today.</p>
      <p>In circumnavigating the globe, Magellan did more than simply prove that such a journey was possible. The length of his journey gave cartographers a tool for estimating the actual size of the earth. His voyage also provided a surprising demonstration of the earth's rotation. After sailing around the world in a westward direction, Magellan's sailors found that their meticulously kept records were "wrong". They had lost a day!</p>
      <p>Magellan gave the <i>Pacific Ocean</i> its name - he called it the "Peaceful Sea".</p>
      <p>While many people know that the straits of Magellan - the passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans discovered by Magellan - bear his name, perhaps fewer are aware of the many other things named after Magellan, which include two craters on the moon, one crater on Mars, two galaxies, and a species of penguin.</p>
