      <h2>Life</h2>
      <p>Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan (c. 1480 - 1521) led the first successful expedition to circumnavigate the globe. Even after nearly 500 years, he is still remembered for his courage and daring.</p>

      <h3>An Idea is Born</h3>
      <p>After working for many years as Portuguese sailor in the spice trade, Magellan determined to find a better route from Europe to the "Spice Islands". If only he could avoid the arduous journey around Africa and India and the heavy taxes and upcharges on imported spices...</p>
      <p>When he came across a report claiming the discovery of a probable sea passage through South America, Magellan was convinced that he had found this "better route".</p>

      <h3>The Journey Begins</h3>
      <p>Once Magellan determined to reach the East by sailing westward, across the Atlantic Ocean, he let nothing stand in his way:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When Portugal refused to sponsor his trip, he sought - and received - Spanish funding for his expedition.</li>
        <li>When Magellan discovered that his source was in error - the promised passageway turned out to only a bay - he refused to turn back and instead began systematically searching the South American coastline for some other passage.</li>
        <li>Even after three of his five ships mutanied and one of his ships deserted and sailed back to Spain with a large quantity of supplies, Magellan refused to turn back.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Price of Victory</h3>
      <p>Magellan's obstinance and daring did pay off: he discovered the Strait of Magellan, successfully crossed the Pacific Ocean and reached the "Spice Islands". But his success came at great cost. Of the 270 men who set sail with Magellan, only 18 remained at the end of the journey - the others being lost mainly to desertion, starvation, shipwreck, or battle.</p>
      <p>In the end, it was Magellan's bravado that got him killed. He died in the Phillipines in the Battle of Mactan, an attempted show of strength intended to convince the monarch of the island Cebu of the power of Spain.</p>

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>Far from forgotten, Magellan's influence and legacy still exist today.</p>
      <p>In circumnavigating the globe, Magellan did more than simply prove that such a journey was possible. The length of his journey gave cartographers a tool for estimating the actual size of the earth. His voyage also provided a surprising demonstration of the earth's rotation. After sailing around the world in a westward direction, Magellan's sailors found that their meticulously kept records were "wrong". They had lost a day!</p>
      <p>Magellan gave the Pacific Ocean its name - he called it the "Peaceful (i.e. Pacific) Sea".</p>
      <p>While many people know that the straits of Magellan - the passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans discovered by Magellan - bear his name, perhaps fewer are aware of the many other things named after Magellan, which include two craters on the moon, one crater on Mars, two galaxies, and a species of penguin.</p>
